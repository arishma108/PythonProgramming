# PythonProgramming

Coming from a Java and C++ programming background word on the street is that Python seems to be the MOST popular, high-level, open-source 
programming language right now!

It is a powerful, fast and dynamic programming language that runs everywhere.
It’s also interactive, object-oriented, and very easy to learn.
Anyone can create programs with it. It’s particularly great for web development, and scientific computing. 
With its vast libraries, it’s also useful for data visualization and data analytics. 

I am choosing to pace myself and start off with Python basics, writing my first program, 

...and then... 

...as I get a little bit more brave I will cover, in detail, types, expressions, variables, strings and string operations. 

PS.
How am I going to move on from this, instead of using curly brackets to write a block of code, I only need to indent the lines.
I guess less “clutter” to write easy-to-read code. 
But, tab is not allowed I have to use spaces rather.
